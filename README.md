# SwitchImageViewer - hekate repurposed as an (incredibly shitty) image viewer
Title says it all :)

# How to use
use the convert_image.pde tool (you'll need [Processing](https://www.processing.org)) to convert an image file to a text file. Place image.txt on the root of a FAT32-formatted SD card and insert it into your Switch. Compile the project, enter RCM mode and use fus√©e-launcher to launch the program.
Enjoy!
